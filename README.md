## Hi there 👋

# Hi there 👋

I'm **hexbit**, an **IT enthusiast**, **ethical hacker**, and **full-stack web developer**.  
I like to break things apart to understand them and put them back together cleaner, faster, and more secure.

---

### 🛠️ What I'm building
- My **Artix Linux rice** with:
  - [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) (dynamic window manager)
  - [slstatus](https://tools.suckless.org/slstatus/) (status bar)
  - [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/) (dynamic menu)
  - [st](https://st.suckless.org/) (simple terminal)  
- Custom configs for productivity, minimalism, and speed — already [pushed here](./) on GitHub.

---

### 🌐 Web & Dev
- Full-stack web developer comfortable across **frontend & backend**.
- I enjoy designing **efficient systems** with a focus on **security** and **performance**.

---

### 🔒 Security & Hacking
- Passionate about **ethical hacking**, penetration testing, and CTFs.
- Proud to be ranked **Top 6 in Lebanon 🇱🇧 on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/)** (local leaderboard).
- Always sharpening my skills in **red teaming**, **defensive security**, and **automation**.

---

### 📚 Currently exploring
- Advanced **Linux internals** and custom builds (Artix, ricing, low-level tweaks).
- More **automation in security workflows**.
- Exploring ways to integrate **ethical hacking tools** into my dev environment.

> ⚡ Fun fact: I prefer **ALSA over PulseAudio/PipeWire** on my Artix setup because I like simplicity and control.
